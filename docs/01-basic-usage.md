# Basic Usage

## Parsing the Field

The first way to use the package is to enable header or trailer parsing. We will refers to them as field
for the rest of the documentation as it is how they are called hence the name of the RFC HTTP structured fields.

Let's say we want to parse the [Permissions-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy#syntax) header as it is defined.
Because the header is defined as a Dictionary field we can easily parse it using the package as follows:

```php
$headerLine = 'picture-in-picture=(), geolocation=(self "https://example.com/"), camera=*'; //the raw header line is a structured field item
$permissions = Dictionary::fromHttpValue($headerLine); // parse the field
```

You will now be able to access each persimission individually as follows:

```php
$permissions['picture-in-picture']->hasNoMembers(); //returns true because the list is empty
$permissions['geolocation'][1]->value(); //returns 'https://example.com/'
count($permissions['geolocation']); // returns 2
$permissions['camera']->value(); //returns '*'
```

Apart from following the specification some syntactic sugar methods have been added to allow for easy access
of the values.

> [!WARNING]
> If parsing or serializing is not possible, a `SyntaxError` exception is thrown with the information about why
the conversion could not be achieved.

## Building the Field

Conversely, if you need to update the permission header, the package allows for a intuitive way to do so:

```php
$newPermissions = $permissions
    ->removeByKeys('camera')
    ->add('gyroscope',  [
        Token::fromString('self'), 
        "https://a.example.com",
        "https://b.example.com"
    ]);
echo $newPermissions; 
//returns picture-in-picture=(), geolocation=(self "https://example.com/"), gyroscope=(self "https://a.example.com" "https://b.example.com")
```

Again if the value given is not supported by the structured field `Dictionary` specification an exception will be
raised. All RFC related classes in the package are immutable which allow for easier manipulation. For a more in depth
presentation of each structure and their method please refer to the RFC.
